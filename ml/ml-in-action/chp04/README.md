General approach to na?ve Bayes
1. Collect: Any method. We°Øll use RSS feeds in this chapter.
2. Prepare: Numeric or Boolean values are needed.
3. Analyze: With many features, plotting features isn°Øt helpful. Looking at histograms is a better idea.
4. Train: Calculate the conditional probabilities of the independent features.
5. Test: Calculate the error rate.
6. Use: One common application of na?ve Bayes is document classification. You
can use na?ve Bayes in any classification setting. It doesn°Øt have to be text.

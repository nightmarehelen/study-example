### KNN算法的缺点 ###
+ 需要大量计算，每次做分类是需要和训练集的所有数据作比较
+ 虽然得出结果，但是得到数据只管的感受

General approach to kNN
1. Collect: Any method.
2. Prepare: Numeric values are needed for a distance calculation. A structured data
format is best.
3. Analyze: Any method.
4. Train: Does not apply to the kNN algorithm.
5. Test: Calculate the error rate.
6. Use: This application needs to get some input data and output structured numeric values. Next, the application runs the kNN algorithm on this input data and
determines which class the input data should belong to. The application then
takes some action on the calculated class.

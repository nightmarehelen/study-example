General approach to decision trees
1. Collect: Any method.
2. Prepare: This tree-building algorithm works only on nominal values, so any continuous values will need to be quantized.
3. Analyze: Any method. You should visually inspect the tree after it is built.
4. Train: Construct a tree data structure.
5. Test: Calculate the error rate with the learned tree.
6. Use: This can be used in any supervised learning task. Often, trees are used to
better understand the data.
